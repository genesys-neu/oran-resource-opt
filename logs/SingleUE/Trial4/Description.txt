This uses the third data set (xxxx_4) collected. When collecting this data, I focused on a specific traffic slice. 
In other words, for the embb traffic, I only streamed YouTube and started and stopped the traffic immediately
before and after streaming YouTube. 

I included a mixed traffic sample that has all traffic types.

I also included a no traffic sample (null) that does not send any user traffic.

These were all generated using RF scenario 1018 (Rome, close, moderate)

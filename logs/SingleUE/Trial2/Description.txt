This is the second data set collected (xxxx_2). When collecting this data, I focused on a specific traffic slice. 
In other words, for the embb traffic, I only streamed YouTube and started and stopped the traffic immediately
before and after streaming YouTube. This was collected on campus, some stationary in ISEC, and some walking.

These were generated using RF scenario 1017 (Rome, close, static)

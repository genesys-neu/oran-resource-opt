When collecting this data, I focused on a specific traffic slice. I captured all trafic on 18 November (xxxx_11_18).
For the embb traffic, I streamed Netflix and started and stopped the traffic immediately
before and after streaming Netflix. I only captured the Netflix traffic. 
For the urllc traffic I used Facebook messenger for live video chat and voice only calls, capturing only the facebook messanger traffic.
For the mmtc, I captured all traffic while not using the UE for anything except text messages (and background traffic).
I captured all traffic in ISEC with no mobility. 


These were all generated using RF scenario 1017. Each of these was generated with two UEs as shown below:

Trial	     	Nodes	
1	URLLC*		URLLC_11_18
2	URLLC_2		EMBB_11_18
3	URLLC_3		MMTC_2
4	eMBB*		EMBB_3
5	EMBB_2		MMTC_3
6	mMTC*		MMTC_11_18

*These outputs were moved to archive because they are the least reliable.

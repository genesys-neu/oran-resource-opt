This was the first data set collected (embb, mmtc, urll). I collected this data over multiple time periods both stationary and moving UE. 
The mmtc includes traffic collected while driving. The urllc traffic was both stationaring and walking. The embb traffic 
was only stationary.
The original data contained one, two, or three of the traffic types. 
After capturing all the data, I seperated it by class type. Next, I combined all the time periods into one file.
Because of this, there may be time gaps when other traffic types was present. That traffic has been removed, 
but leaves behind empty time.


These were generated using RF scenario 1017 (Rome, close, static)

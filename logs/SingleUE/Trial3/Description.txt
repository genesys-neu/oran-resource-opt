This is the third data set collected (xxxx_3). When collecting this data, I focused on a specific traffic slice. 
In other words, for the embb traffic, I only streamed YouTube and started and stopped the traffic immediately
before and after streaming YouTube. This was collected in ISEC, mostly stationary.

I also included a mixed traffic sample that has all traffic types.

These were generated using RF scenario 1017 (Rome, close, static)
